# Arson Prediction
In collaboration with Hull City Council, this project involves using multiple data sources in order to create a model for predicting arson attacks in Hull. Most of the data used have both spatial and temporal components.

If following the R code, run compare_lsoas.R before deprivation_lsoas.R.

If following the Jupyter Notebooks, run model_data.ipynb before ml_models.ipynb
